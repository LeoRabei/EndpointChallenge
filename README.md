# Directory Management Simulation

This is a project that simulates directory operations without actually creating folders on the host machine

## Overview

By feeding a predefined hardcoded set of commands, this script simulates:
- Creating directories
- Moving directories
- Deleting directories
- Listing the directory structure

## Setup and execution

1. *Node.js*
Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) or install using a terminal: 
 - Linux (Ubuntu/Debian): sudo apt install nodejs
 - macOS: brew install node 

 After installing, run node -v in the terminal to check if it's installed and see the version.


2. *Clone the Repository*

Inside the terminal, navigate to a desired location and clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/LeoRabei/EndpointChallenge.git
   cd EndpointChallenge

3. *Run the project*

  node directories.js
